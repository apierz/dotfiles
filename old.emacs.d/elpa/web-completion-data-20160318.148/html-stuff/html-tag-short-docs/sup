The HTML Superscript Element (<sup>) defines a span of text that should be displayed, for typographic reasons, higher, and often smaller, than the main span of text.

Usage note:

This element should be used for typographical reasons only, i.e. changing the position of the text changing its meaning like in mathematical (like f4, though the use of a MathML formula should be considered) or in French abbreviations (like Mlle, Mme or Cie).
This element must not be used for styling purpose like the styling of the product name Latex. In that case CSS style should be used: the vertical-align property with the super value will achieve the same effect.
