The HTML <marquee> element is used to insert a scrolling area of text.

Non-standard
This feature is non-standard and is not on a standards track. Do not use it on production sites facing the Web: it will not work for every user. There may also be large incompatibilities between implementations and the behavior may change in the future.

Notes:
The marquee element is originally an IE invention.
The marquee element is not valid according to the HTML or XHTML specifications. Page authors concerned with validation should not use this tag.
The marquee element is implemented in Mozilla (Firefox) by using an XBL binding; see /layout/style/xbl-marquee/xbl-marquee.xml.
