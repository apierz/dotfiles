The HTML <hgroup> Element (HTML Headings Group Element) represents the heading of a section. It defines a single title that participates in the outline of the document as the heading of the implicit or explicit section that it belongs to.

Its text for the outline algorithm is the text of the first HTML Heading Element of highest rank (i.e., the first <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> or <h6> with the smallest number among its descendants) and the rank is the rank of this very same HTML Heading Element.

Therefore this element groups several headings, contributing only the main one to the outline of the document. It allows associating secondary titles, like subheadings, alternative titles, or even taglines, with the main heading, without polluting the outline of the document.
