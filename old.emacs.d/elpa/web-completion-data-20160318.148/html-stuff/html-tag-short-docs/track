The HTML <track> element is used as a child of the media elementsâ€”<audio> and <video>. It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automaticaly handle subtitles.

The type of data that track adds to the media is set in the kind attribute, which can take values of subtitles, captions, descriptions, chapters or metadata. The element points to a source file containing timed text that the browser exposes when the user requests additional data.

A media element cannot have more than one track with the same kind, srclang, and label.
