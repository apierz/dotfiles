The Word Break Opportunity (<wbr>) HTML element represents a position within text where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would not otherwise create a break at that location.

On UTF-8 encoded pages, <wbr> behaves like the U+200B ZERO-WIDTH SPACE code point. In particular, it behaves like a Unicode bidi BN code point, meaning it has no effect on bidi-ordering: <div dir=rtl>123,<wbr>456</div> displays, when not broken on two lines, 123,456 and not 456,123.

For the same reason, the <﻿wbr﻿> element does not introduce a hyphen at the line break point. To make a hyphen appear only at the end of a line, use the soft hyphen character entity (&﻿shy;) instead.

This element was first implemented in Internet Explorer 5.5 and was officially defined in HTML5.
