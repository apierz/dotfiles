The HTML <time> element represents either a time on a 24-hour clock or a precise date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information).

This element is intended to be used presenting dates and times in a machine readable format. This can be helpful for user agents to offer any event scheduling for user's calendar. 

Usage note: 
This element is not appropriate for instances where a specific date cannot be calculated, nor should it be used for dates prior to the introduction to the Gregorian calendar (due to complications with calculating those dates).
