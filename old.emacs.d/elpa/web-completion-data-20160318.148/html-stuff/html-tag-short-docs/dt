The HTML <dt> element (or HTML Definition Term Element) identifies a term in a definition list. This element can occur only as a child element of a <dl>. It is usually followed by a <dd> element; however, multiple <dt> elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next <dd> element.

Content categories:
None.

Permitted content:
FIXME: Flow content, but with no <header>, <footer>, sectioning content or heading content descendants.

Tag omission:
Must have a start tag. The end tag may be omitted if this element is immediately followed by another <dd> element, or if there is no more content in the parent element.

Permitted parent elements:
Before a <dt> or a <dd> element, inside a <dl>.

DOM interface:
HTMLElement Up to Gecko 1.9.2 (Firefox 4) inclusive, Firefox implements the HTMLSpanElement interface for this element.
