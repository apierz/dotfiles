Otherwise, one or more elements of metadata content where exactly one is a <title> element.

The start tag may be omitted if the first thing inside the head element is an element.

Notes:
Most browsers automatically construct a <head> element if the tags are omitted in the markup. However some do not.
These browsers were tested as not creating a head element automatically: Android <=1.6, iPhone <=3.1.3, Nokia 90, Opera <=9.27, and Safari <=3.2.1.
