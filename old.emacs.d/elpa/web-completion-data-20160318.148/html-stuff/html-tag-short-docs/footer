The HTML <footer> Element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element (i.e, its nearest parent <article>, <aside>, <nav>, <section>, <blockquote>, <body>, <details>, <fieldset>, <figure>, <td>). A footer typically contains information about the author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

Usage notes:
Enclose information about the author in an <address> element that can be included into the <footer> element.
The <footer> element is not sectioning content and therefore doesn't introduce a new section in the outline.

Content categories:
Flow content, palpable content.

Permitted content:
Flow content, but with no <footer> or <header> descendants.

Tag omission:
None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.

Permitted parent elements:
Any element that accepts flow content. Note that a <footer> element must not be a descendant of an <address>, <header> or another <footer> element.
