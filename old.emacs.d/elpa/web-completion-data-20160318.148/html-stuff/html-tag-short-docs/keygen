The HTML keygen element exists to facilitate generation of key material, and submission of the public key as part of an HTML form. This mechanism is designed for use with Web-based certificate management systems. It is expected that the keygen element will be used in an HTML form along with other information needed to construct a certificate request, and that the result of the process will be a signed certificate.
