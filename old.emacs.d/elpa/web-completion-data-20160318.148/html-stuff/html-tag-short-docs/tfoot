The HTML Table Foot Element (<tfoot>) defines a set of rows summarizing the columns of the table.

Content categories:
None.

Permitted content:
Zero or more <tr> elements.

Tag omission:
The start tag is mandatory. The end tag may be omitted if the <tbody> element is immediately followed by an, eventually implicitly-defined, <tbody>, of if there is no more content in the parent <table> element.

Permitted parent elements:
A <table> element. The <tfoot> must appears after any <caption>, <colgroup> or <thead> element. It can be before or after all <tbody> and <tr> elements, but not intermixed with them.
HTML 4 The <tfoot> element cannot be placed after any <tbody> and <tr> element. This restriction has been softened in HTML5.

DOM interface:
This element implements the HTMLTableSectionElement interface.
