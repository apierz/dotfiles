rowspan

This attribute contains a non-negative integer value that indicates on how many rows does the cell extend. Its default value is 1; if its value is set to 0, it does extend until the end of the table section (<thead>, <tbody>, <tfoot>, eventually implicitly defined) the cell belongs to. Values higher than 65534 are clipped down to 65534.
