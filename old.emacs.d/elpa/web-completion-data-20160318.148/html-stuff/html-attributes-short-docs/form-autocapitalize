autocapitalize [!]

This is a nonstandard attribute used by iOS Safari Mobile which controls whether and how the text value for textual form control descendants should be automatically capitalized as it is entered/edited by the user. If the autocapitalize attribute is specified on an individual form control descendant, it trumps the form-wide autocapitalize setting. The non-deprecated values are available in iOS 5 and later. The default value is sentences. Possible values are:
  none: Completely disables automatic capitalization
  sentences: Automatically capitalize the first letter of sentences.
  words: Automatically capitalize the first letter of words.
  characters: Automatically capitalize all characters.
  on:  Deprecated since iOS 5.
  off:  Deprecated since iOS 5.
