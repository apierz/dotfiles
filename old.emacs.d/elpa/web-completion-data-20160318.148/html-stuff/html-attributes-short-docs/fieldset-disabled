disabled [HTML5]

If this Boolean attribute is set, the form controls that are its descendants, except descendants of its first optional <legend> element, are disabled, i.e., not editable. They won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones. Often browsers display such controls as gray.
