low

The upper numeric bound of the low end of the measured range. This must be greater than the minimum value (min attribute), and it also must be less than the high value and maximum value (high attribute and max attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If unspecified, or if less than the minimum value, the low value is equal to the minimum value.
