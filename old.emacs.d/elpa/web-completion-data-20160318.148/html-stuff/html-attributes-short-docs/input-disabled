disabled

This Boolean attribute indicates that the form control is not available for interaction. In particular, the click event will not be dispatched on disabled controls. Also, a disabled control's value isn't submitted with the form.

Firefox will, unlike other browsers, by default, persist the dynamic disabled state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature.
