autobuffer [Obsolete since Gecko 2.0]

A Boolean attribute; if specified, the audio will automatically begin being downloaded, even if not set to automatically play. This continues until the media cache is full, or the entire audio file has been downloaded, whichever comes first. This should only be used when it is expected that the user will choose to play the audio; for example, if the user has navigated to a page using a "Play this audio" link. This attribute was removed in Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1) in favor of the preload attribute.
