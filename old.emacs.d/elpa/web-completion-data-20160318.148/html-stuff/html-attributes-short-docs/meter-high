high

The lower numeric bound of the high end of the measured range. This must be less than the maximum value (max attribute), and it also must be greater than the low value and minimum value (low attribute and min attribute, respectively), if any are specified. If unspecified, or if greater than the maximum value, the high value is equal to the maximum value.
