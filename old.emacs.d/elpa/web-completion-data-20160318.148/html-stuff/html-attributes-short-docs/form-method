method

The HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:
  post: Corresponds to the HTTP POST method ; form data are included in the body of the form and sent to the server.
  get: Corresponds to the HTTP GET method; form data are appended to the action attribute URI with a '?' as separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII characters.
This value can be overridden by a formmethod attribute on a <button> or <input> element.
