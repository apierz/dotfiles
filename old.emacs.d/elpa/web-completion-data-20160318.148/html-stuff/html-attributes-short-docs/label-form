form [HTML5]

The form element that the label element is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be an ID of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, this <label> element must be a descendant of a <form> element. This attribute enables you to place label elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements.
