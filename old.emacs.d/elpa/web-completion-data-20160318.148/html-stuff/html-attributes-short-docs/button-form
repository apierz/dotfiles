form [HTML5]

The form element that the button is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be the id attribute of a <form> element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, the <button> element must be a descendant of a form element. This attribute enables you to place <button> elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their <form> elements.
