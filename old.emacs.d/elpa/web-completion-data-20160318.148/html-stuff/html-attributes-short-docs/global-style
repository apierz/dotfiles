Defines CSS styles which will override styles previously set.

This attribute contains CSS styling declarations to be applied to the element. Note that it is recommended for styles to be defined in a separate file or files. This attribute and the <style> element have mainly the purpose of allowing for quick styling, for example for testing purposes.

Usage note:
This attribute must not be used to convey semantic information. Even if all styling is removed, a page should remain semantically correct. Typically it shouldn't be used to hide irrelevant information; this should be done using the hidden attribute.
