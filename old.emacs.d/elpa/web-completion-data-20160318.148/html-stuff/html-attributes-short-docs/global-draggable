Defines whether the element can be dragged.

This enumerated attribute indicates whether the element can be dragged, using the Drag and Drop API. It can have the following values:

true, which indicates that the element may be dragged.
false, which indicates that the element may not be dragged.

If this attribute is not set, its default value is auto, meaning the behavior should be the one defined by default by the browser.

Usage notes:
This attribute is an enumerated one and not a Boolean one. This means that the explicit usage of one of the values true or false is mandatory and that a shorthand like <label draggable>Example Label</label> is not allowed. The correct usage is <label draggable="true">Example Label</label>.
By default, only text selections, images, and links can be dragged. For all others elements, the event ondragstart must be set in order to the drag and drop mechanism to work, as shown in this comprehensive example.
