optimum

This attribute indicates the optimal numeric value. It must be within the range (as defined by the min attribute and max attribute). When used with the low attribute and high attribute, it gives an indication where along the range is considered preferable. For example, if it is between the min attribute and the low attribute, then the lower range is considered preferred.
