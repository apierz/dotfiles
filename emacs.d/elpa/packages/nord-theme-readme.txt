An unofficial port of the Nord Theme, created by Artic Ice Studio.

This theme attempts to mimic the color choices and syntax highlighting of
the Vim version of this theme whereever possible, but also includes a few
tweaks and support for many Emacs modes such as Mu4e, Gnus, Org, Helm,
Powerline and more.

This theme is designed to work in both GUI and terminal interfaces, however
it requires using Nord Colors in your terminal to display properply.
