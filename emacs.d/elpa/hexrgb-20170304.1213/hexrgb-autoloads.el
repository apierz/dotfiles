(autoload 'hexrgb-read-color "hexrgb" "\
Read a color name or hex RGB hexadecimal color value #RRRRGGGGBBBB.
Completion is available for color names, but not for RGB hex strings.
If you input an RGB hex string, it must have the form #XXXXXXXXXXXX or
XXXXXXXXXXXX, where each X is a hex digit.  The number of Xs must be a
multiple of 3, with the same number of Xs for each of red, green, and
blue.  The order is red, green, blue.

Color names that are normally considered equivalent are canonicalized:
They are lowercased, whitespace is removed, and duplicates are
eliminated.  E.g. \"LightBlue\" and \"light blue\" are both replaced
by \"lightblue\".  If you do not want this behavior, but want to
choose names that might contain whitespace or uppercase letters, then
customize option `hexrgb-canonicalize-defined-colors-flag' to nil.

In addition to standard color names and RGB hex values, the following
are available as color candidates.  In each case, the corresponding
color is used.

* `*copied foreground*'  - last copied foreground, if available
* `*copied background*'  - last copied background, if available
* `*mouse-2 foreground*' - foreground where you click `mouse-2'
* `*mouse-2 background*' - background where you click `mouse-2'
* `*point foreground*'   - foreground under the cursor
* `*point background*'   - background under the cursor

\(You can copy a color using eyedropper commands such as
`eyedrop-pick-foreground-at-mouse'.)

Optional arg PROMPT is the prompt - nil means use a default prompt.

Checks input to be sure it represents a valid color.  If not, raises
an error (but see exception for empty input with non-nil
ALLOW-EMPTY-NAME-P).

Interactively, or with optional arg CONVERT-TO-RGB-P non-nil, converts
an input color name to an RGB hex string.  Returns the RGB hex string.

Optional arg ALLOW-EMPTY-NAME-P controls what happens if you enter an
empty color name (that is, you just hit `RET').  If non-nil, then
`hexrgb-read-color' returns an empty color name, \"\".  If nil, then
it raises an error.  Calling programs must test for \"\" if
ALLOW-EMPTY-NAME-P is non-nil.  They can then perform an appropriate
action in case of empty input.

Interactively, or with non-nil MSGP, show color name in the echo area.
