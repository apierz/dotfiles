!DEPRECATED!

The entire content of this element is centered horizontally within its containing element (typically, the <body>). This tag has been deprecated in HTML 4 (and XHTML 1) in favor of the CSS text-align property, which can be applied to the <div> element or to an individual <p>.

This element implements the HTMLElement interface.
