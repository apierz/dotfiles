OBSOLETE

<spacer> is an HTML element which is used for inserting white spaces to web pages. It was created by NetScape for achieving same effect as a single-pixel layout GIF image, which was something web designers used to use to add white spaces to web pages, without actually using a GIF. However <spacer> is not supported by any major browser and same effects can be created with various CSS rules. In Mozilla applications, support for this element was removed in GeckoÂ 2.0. Therefore usage of <spacer> is unnecessary.
