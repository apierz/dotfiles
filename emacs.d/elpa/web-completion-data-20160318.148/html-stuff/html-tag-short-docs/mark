The HTML <mark> Element represents highlighted text, i.e., a run of text marked for reference purpose, due to its relevance in a particular context. For example it can be used in a page showing search results to highlight every instance of the searched for word.

Usage notes:

In a quotation or another block, the highlighted text typically marks text that is referenced outside the quote, or marked for specific scrutiny even though the original author didn't consider it important.
In the main text, the highlighted text typically marks text that may be of special relevance for the user's current activity, like search results.
Do not use the <mark> element for syntax highlighting; use the <span> element for this purpose.
Do not confuse the <mark> element with the <strong> element. The <strong> element is used to denote spans of text of importance in context of the text, when the <mark> element is used to denote spans of text of relevance to a different context.
