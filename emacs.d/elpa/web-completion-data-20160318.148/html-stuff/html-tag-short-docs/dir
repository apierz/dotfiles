!OBSOLETE!

The HTML directory element (<dir>) represents a directory, namely a collection of filenames.

This feature is obsolete. Although it may still work in some browsers, its use is discouraged since it could be removed at any time. Try to avoid using it.

Usage note: 
Do not use this element. Though present in the early HTML specification, it has been deprecated in HTML 4, then is obsolete in HTML5. Use the <ul> instead.
