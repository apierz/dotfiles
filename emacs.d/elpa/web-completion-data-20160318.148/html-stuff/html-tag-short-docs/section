The HTML Section Element (<section>) represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <section> element.

Usage notes:
If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a <section> element, use an <article> element instead.
Do not use the <section> element as a generic container; this is what <div> is for, especially when the sectioning is only for styling purposes. A rule of thumb is that a section should logically appear in the outline of a document.
