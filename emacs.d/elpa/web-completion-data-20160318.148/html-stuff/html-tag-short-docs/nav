The HTML Navigation Element (<nav>) represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page: a section with navigation links.

Usage notes:

Not all links of a document must be in a <nav> element, which is intended only for major block of navigation links; typically the <footer> element often has a list of links that don't need to be in a <nav> element.
A document may have several <nav> elements, for example, one for site navigation and one for intra-page navigation.
User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.
