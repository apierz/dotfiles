placeholder [HTML5]

A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored.

Note:
Do not use the placeholder attribute instead of a <label> element. Their purposes are different: the <label> attribute describes the role of the form element; that is, it indicates what kind of information is expected, the placeholder attribute is a hint about the format the content should take. There are cases in which the placeholder attribute is never displayed to the user, so the form must be understandable without it.
