colspan

This attribute contains a non-negative integer value that indicates on how many columns does the cell extend. Its default value is 1; if its value is set to 0, it does extend until the end of the <colgroup>, eventually implicitly defined, the cell belongs to. Values higher than 1000 are clipped down to 1000.
