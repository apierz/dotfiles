Indicates whether the element's content is editable.

This enumerated attribute indicates if the element should be editable by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow editing. The attribute must take one of the following values:

true or the empty string, which indicates that the element must be editable;

false, which indicates that the element must not be editable.

If this attribute is not set, its default value is inherited from its parent element.

Usage note:
This attribute is an enumerated one and not a Boolean one. This means that the explicit usage of one of the values true, false or the empty string is mandatory and that a shorthand like <label contenteditable>Example Label</label> is not allowed. The correct usage is <label contenteditable="true">Example Label</label>.
