align [Deprecated since HTML4.01] [Obsolete since HTML5]

This enumerated attribute indicates how the caption must be aligned with respect to the table. It may have the following values:
  left, displayed to the left of the table
  top, displayed before the the table
  right, displayed to the right of the table
  bottom, displayed under the table
  
Usage note: 
Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the <caption> element should be styled using CSS. To give a similar effect to the align attribute, use the the CSS properties caption-side and text-align.
