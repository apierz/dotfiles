sizes [Experimental]

Is a list of source sizes that describes the final rendered width of the image represented by the source. Each source size consists of a comma-separated list of media condition-length pairs. This information is used by the browser to determine, before laying the page out, which image defined in srcset to use.
The sizes attribute has an effect only when the <source> element is the direct child of a <picture> element.
