start [HTML5]

This integer attribute specifies the start value for numbering the individual list items. Although the ordering type of list elements might be Roman numerals, such as XXXI, or letters, the value of start is always represented as a number. To start numbering elements from the letter "C", use <ol start="3">.

Note: 
This attribute was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced in HTML5.
