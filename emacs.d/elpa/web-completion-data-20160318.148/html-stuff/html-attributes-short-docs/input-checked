checked [Boolean]

When the value of the type attribute is radio or checkbox, the presence of this Boolean attribute indicates that the control is selected by default; otherwise it is ignored.

Firefox will, unlike other browsers, by default, persist the dynamic checked state of an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature.
