size

The initial size of the control. This value is in pixels unless the value of the type attribute is text or password, in which case, it is an integer number of characters. Starting in HTML5, this attribute applies only when the type attribute is set to text, search, tel, url, email, or password; otherwise it is ignored. In addition, the size must be greater than zero. If you don't specify a size, a default value of 20 is used.
