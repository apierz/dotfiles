Indicates whether spell checking is allowed for the element.

This enumerated attribute defines whether the element may be checked for spelling errors. It may have the following values:

true, which indicates that the element should be, if possible, checked for spelling errors;
false, which indicates that the element should not be checked for spelling errors.

If this attribute is not set, its default value is element-type and browser-defined. This default value may also be inherited, which means that the element content will be checked for spelling errors only if its nearest ancestor has a spellcheck state of true.

Usage note:
his attribute is an enumerated one and not a Boolean one. This means that the explicit usage of one of the values true or false is mandatory and that a shorthand like <label spellcheck>Example Label</label> is not allowed. The correct usage is <label spellcheck="true">Example Label</label>.
This attribute is merely a hint for the browser: browsers are not required to be able to check for spelling errors. Typically non-editable elements are not checked for spelling errors, even if the spellcheck attribute is set to true and the browser supports spellchecking.
The default value of this attribute is browser and element-dependant.
