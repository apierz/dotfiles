The HTML <menu> element represents a group of commands that a user can perform or activate. This includes both toolbar menus, which might appear across the top of a screen, as well as popup menus, such as those that might appear underneath a button after it has been clicked.

This is an experimental technology.

Browser compatibility:
Unknown

Usage note: 
The <menu> and <ul> elements both represent an unordered list of items. The key difference is that <ul> primarily contains items for display, whilst <menu> is intended for interactive items, to act on.

Content categories:
Flow content. Additionally, if in the toolbar menu state, palpable content. (Toolbar menu is the default state, unless the parent element is a <menu> in the popup menu state.)

Permitted content:
If the element is in the toolbar menu state: flow content, or alternatively, zero or more occurences of <li>, <script> and <template>.
If the element is in the popup menu state: zero or more occurences, in any order, of <menu> (popup menu state only), <menuitem>, <hr>, <script>, and <template>.

Tag omission:
None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.

Permitted parent elements:
Any element that accepts flow content.
