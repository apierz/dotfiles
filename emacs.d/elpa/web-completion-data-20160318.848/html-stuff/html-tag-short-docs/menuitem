The HTML <menuitem> element represents a command that a user is able to invoke through a popup menu. This includes context menus, as well as menus that might be attached to a menu button.

A command can either be defined explicitly, with a textual label and optional icon to describe its appearance, or alternatively as an indirect command whose behavior is defined by a separate element. Commands can also optionally include a checkbox or be grouped to share radio buttons. (Menu items for indirect commands gain checkboxes or radio buttons when defined against elements <input type="checkbox"> and <input type="radio">.)

This is an experimental technology.
