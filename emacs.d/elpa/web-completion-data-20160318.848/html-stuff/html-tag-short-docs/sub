The HTML Subscript Element (<sub>) defines a span of text that should be displayed, for typographic reasons, lower, and often smaller, than the main span of text.

Usage note:

This element should be used for typographical reasons only, i.e. changing the position of the text changing its meaning like in mathematical (like t2, though the use of a MathML formula should be considered) or chemical formulas (like H2O).
This element must not be used for styling purpose like the styling of the product name Latex. In that case CSS style should be used: the vertical-align property with the sub value will achieve the same effect.
