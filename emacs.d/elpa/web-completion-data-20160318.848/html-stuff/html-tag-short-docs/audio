The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain several audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source> element; the browser will choose the most suitable one.

Fallback content for browser not supporting the <audio> element can be added too.

You can use the enhanced audio API features — which are Gecko-specific — to directly generate and manipulate audio streams from JavaScript code. See Introducing the audio API extension for details.

Content categories:
Flow content, phrasing content, embedded content. If it has a controls attribute: interactive content and palpable content.

Permitted content:
If the element has a src attribute: zero or more <track> element, followed by transparent content that contains no media elements, that is no <audio> or <video>
Else: zero or more <source> element, followed by zero or more <track> element, followed by transparent content that contains no media elements, that is no <audio> or <video>.

Tag omission:
None, both the starting and ending tag are mandatory.

Permitted parent elements:
Any element that accepts embedded content.
