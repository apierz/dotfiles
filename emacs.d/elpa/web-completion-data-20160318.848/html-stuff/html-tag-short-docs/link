The HTML Link Element (<link>) specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation. This Element is most used to link to style sheets.

Content categories:
Metadata content. If itemprop is present: flow content phrasing content.

Permitted content:
None, it is an empty element.

Tag omission:
As it is a void element, the start tag must be present and the end tag must not be present.

Permitted parent elements:
Any element that accepts metadata elements. If itemprop is present: any element that accepts phrasing content.

DOM interface:
HTMLLinkElement

Notes:
A <link> tag can occur only in the head element; however, there can be multiple occurrences of <link>.

The HTML and XHTML specifications define event handlers for the <link> element, but it is unclear how they would be used.
