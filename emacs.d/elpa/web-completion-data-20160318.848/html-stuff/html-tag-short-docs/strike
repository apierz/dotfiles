!OBSOLETE!

The HTML Strikethrough Element (<strike>) renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it.

Usage Note: 
As with all purely styling elements, <strike> has been deprecated in HTML 4 and XHTML 1, and obsoleted in HTML5. If semantically appropriate, i.e., if it represents deleted content, use the <del> instead; in all other cases use a <span> element and style it with the CSS text-decoration property, with the line-through value.
