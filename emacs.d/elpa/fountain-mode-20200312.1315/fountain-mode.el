;; # Fountain Mode #

;; Fountain Mode is a scriptwriting program for GNU Emacs using the
;; Fountain plain text markup format.

;; For more information on the Fountain format, visit <https://fountain.io>.

;; ## Features ##

;; - Support for Fountain 1.1 specification
;; - WYSIWYG auto-align elements (display only, does not modify file
;;   contents) specific to script format, e.g. screenplay, stageplay or
;;   user-defined format
;; - Traditional TAB auto-completion writing style
;; - Navigation by section, scene, character name, or page
;; - Integration with outline to fold/cycle visibility of sections and
;;   scenes
;; - Integration with imenu (sections, scene headings, notes)
;; - Intergration with auto-insert for title page metadata
;; - Automatically add/remove character (CONT'D)
;; - Toggle visibility of emphasis delimiters and syntax characters
;; - 3 levels of syntax highlighting
;; - Optionally display scene numbers in the right margin
;; - Intelligent insertion of a page breaks

;; Most common features are accessible from the menu. For a full list of
;; functions and key-bindings, type C-h m.

;; ## Requirements ##

;; - Emacs 24.5

;; ## Exporting ##

;; Earlier versions of Fountain Mode had export functionality, but this was
;; never very good and there are several external tools available that better
;; handle exporting:

;; - [afterwriting](https://github.com/ifrost/afterwriting-labs/blob/master/docs/clients.md) (JavaScript)
;; - [Wrap](https://github.com/Wraparound/wrap) (Go)
;; - [screenplain](https://github.com/vilcans/screenplain) (Python 2)
;; - [Textplay](https://github.com/olivertaylor/Textplay) (Ruby, requires PrinceXML for PDF)

;; ## Installation ##

;; The latest stable release of Fountain Mode is available via
;; [MELPA-stable] and can be installed with:

;;     M-x package-install RET fountain-mode RET

;; Alternately, download the [latest release], move this file into your
;; load-path and add to your init.el file:

;;     (require 'fountain-mode)

;; If you prefer the latest but perhaps unstable version, install via
;; [MELPA], or clone the repository into your load-path and require as
;; above:

;;     git clone https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode.git

;; [melpa]: https://melpa.org/#/fountain-mode "MELPA"
;; [melpa-stable]: https://stable.melpa.org/#/fountain-mode "MELPA-stable"
;; [latest release]: https://github.com/rnkn/fountain-mode/releases/latest "Fountain Mode latest release"
