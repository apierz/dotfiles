Here are some things you should try before filing a bug report:

+ Run `make install` to ensure all plugins are installed.
+ `void-function` or `void-variable` errors could signal an out-of-date autoloads file. Run `make autoloads` or `M-x doom//reload-autoloads` to update it.
+ Scan for common OS/environment issues with `make doctor`.
+ Never debug byte-compiled code. It will interfere in subtle ways. Clean up \*.elc files with `make clean` or `M-x doom//clean-byte-compiled-files`.
+ Check [the FAQ](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/wiki/FAQ#troubleshooting) to see if your issue is mentioned.
+ Check the relevant module's README.org, if one exists. There may be extra steps to getting certain features to work.

If none of those help, remove this section and fill out the four sections in the template below.
