* Install
Some languages require additional setup, and some languages may have no
completion support at all.

Check the README.org in that language's module for details.

* Configure
** Auto-completion
By default, I've disabled auto-completion. This is my preference. I prefer to
invoke company when I need it by calling ~company-complete~ manually (typically,
bound to =C-SPC= in insert mode). However, some may not share my preference.

To enable auto-completion you must:

1. Load ~company~,
2. and change ~company-idle-delay~ to a non-nil float (the default is 0.5)

For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'company)
(setq company-idle-delay 0.2
      company-minimum-prefix-length 3)
#+END_SRC

* Troubleshooting
If completion isn't working for you, please consider the following before
posting a bug report:

+ If what you are expecting is popup-as-you-type completion (which is disabled
  by default), see the "Configure > Auto-completion" section above, which will
  instruct you on how to enable this.
+ Some languages don't have any auto-completion support at all.
