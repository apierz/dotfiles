#+TITLE: :feature workspaces

This module adds support for workspaces, powered by persp_mode, as well as a API
for manipulating them.

#+begin_quote
There are many ways to use workspaces. I spawn a workspace per task. Say I'm
working in the main workspace, when I realize there is a bug in another part of
my project. I open a new workspace and deal with it in there. In the meantime, I
need to check my email, so mu4e gets its own workspace.

Once I've completed the task, I close the workspace and return to main.

* Install
This module has no additional dependencies.

* Features
** Isolated buffer-list
When persp-mode is active, ~doom-buffer-list~ becomes workspace-restricted. You
can overcome this by using ~buffer-list~.

** Automatic workspaces
A workspace is automatically created (and switched to) when you:

+ Create a new frame (with =make-frame=; bound to =M-N= by default).
+ Switch to a project using ~projectile-switch-project~.

** Session persistence
By default, your session is autosaved when you quit Emacs (or disable
~persp-mode~). You can load a previous session with ~M-x
+workspace/load-session~ or ~:sl[oad]~ (ex command).

You can supply either a name to load a specific session to replace your current
one.

** Workspace persistence
If you'd like to save a specific workspace, use ~M-x +workspace/save~, which can
be loaded into the current session (as another workspace) with ~M-x
+workspace/load~.

* Appendix
** Commands & Keybindings
Here is a list of available commands, their default keybindings (defined in
[[../../private/default/+bindings.el][private/default/+bindings.el]]), and corresponding ex commands (if any -- defined
in [[../../private/default/+evil-commands.el][private/default/+evil-commands.el]]).
