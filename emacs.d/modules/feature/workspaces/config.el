;; `persp-mode' gives me workspaces, a workspace-restricted `buffer-list', and
;; file-based session persistence. I used workgroups2 before this, but abandoned
;; it because it was unstable and slow; `persp-mode' is neither (and still
;; maintained).
;;
;; By default, sessions are autosaved, but not autoloaded. Use :ss or
;; `+workspace/save-session' to save, and :sl or `+workspace/load-session' to
;; load the last autosaved session. You can give sessions a custom name so they
;; can be loaded later.
;;
;; NOTE persp-mode requires `workgroups' for file persistence in Emacs 24.4.
