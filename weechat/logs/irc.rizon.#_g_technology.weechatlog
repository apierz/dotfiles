2016-09-05 08:42:21	SmartyPants	It is sad though. Technology has in large part led to the feminization of the male. A "technical person" in the 50's was someone who knew how to work a car. Now a "techincal person" is someone who spends all day indoors. Men are weaker and as a result we are less masculine.
