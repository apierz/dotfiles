2016-08-16 19:08:01	ArchNewb	hi guys, I'm trying to set up arch on an old PC (pentium 4) but it won't boot from that CD. It will boot from other CDs and my machine can boot from the arch CD no problem. Got any suggestions?

2016-08-16 19:09:17	ArchNewb	teaspoon: setting up PXE sounds more complex than doing it via a CD, that's why I thought I should give troubleshooting it first will be better.
2016-08-16 19:09:30	ArchNewb	Is it possible arch is "too new" for that PC?
