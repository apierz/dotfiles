2016-08-17 07:59:53	Saimeidae	group buy
2016-08-17 07:59:55	Saimeidae	so more or less
2016-08-17 08:00:00	snelly	who makes the actual kb?

2016-08-17 08:02:44	Saimeidae	yeah that's definitely a Phantom + TEX TKL alu case
2016-08-17 08:03:01	snelly	ok...so I can solder.  Presumably I could buy one of these Tex aluminum cases, and then find a PCB somewhere

2016-09-05 09:47:24	CAPITALLETTERMAN	Should I clip the leads to be about the same length as the switch leads?

2016-09-05 09:49:19	Joric	i did. twice
2016-09-05 09:49:39	CAPITALLETTERMAN	Damn Joric. Do you have specialized desoldering gear like a Hakko or something?
2016-09-05 09:50:05	Joric	kinda. wouldn't make it with a hand pump
2016-09-05 09:50:28	Joric	electric (heated) solder sucker is much better
2016-09-05 09:50:43	Saimeidae	but that's just a pump
2016-09-05 09:50:50	Saimeidae	er, desoldering gun
2016-09-05 09:51:19	Joric	yep, still much better than an unheated one
2016-09-05 09:51:28	Saimeidae	still a completely different tool
2016-09-05 09:51:33	Saimeidae	so it'd be confusing to call it that
2016-09-05 09:51:38	Saimeidae	because it's a desoldering gun
2016-09-05 09:52:50	Joric	most joints were done in one take
2016-09-05 09:52:53	CAPITALLETTERMAN	What's the difference?

2016-09-05 09:53:16	Joric	nah
2016-09-05 09:53:18	Saimeidae	one is a dinky piece of plastic with a big-ass spring in it
2016-09-05 09:53:41	Joric	i mean solder sucker vs heated solder sucker, pretty similar things
2016-09-05 09:53:49	CAPITALLETTERMAN	There's the electric vacuum ones too right?
2016-09-05 09:54:08	Joric	smth like this http://thumbs1.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/m0oeOtW5NhPei3wDMcVNM-g.jpg

2016-09-05 09:56:08	CAPITALLETTERMAN	My Planck was done with a $15 iron from Canadian Tire.
2016-09-05 09:56:23	Saimeidae	still inadvisable tho
2016-09-05 09:56:33	Saimeidae	because you will be far more likely to destroy the board
2016-09-05 09:56:38	Saimeidae	than by buying something decent
2016-09-05 09:56:43	Saimeidae	especially when you get to desoldering
2016-09-05 09:57:28	CAPITALLETTERMAN	True. That may be where things get dicey using crappy equipment.
2016-09-05 09:57:46	CAPITALLETTERMAN	I'll let you know after the warranty on my Cooler Master QFTK runs out.

2016-09-05 12:10:10	eszett	@legends. The lasercutting service where i order my acrylic layers, can engrave anything for cheap money. I wonder why the same method isn't yet used for engraving blank keycaps. The only problem there would be how to fix the keycaps, so that they can't move anymore, when the laser is doing its job with engraving legends.

2016-09-05 12:12:56	Saimeidae	it just doesn't feel nice

2016-10-02 12:23:38	skullY	some people would say you should put the int() on its own line, or as part of the original pid = line
2016-10-02 12:23:45	skullY	but that's really a personal taste question
2016-10-02 12:23:56	skullY	some people would say I should put the .strip() on its own line
2016-10-02 12:24:33	slaytaner	I guess you could get a really long line of function calls
2016-10-02 12:26:13	skullY	you could
2016-10-02 12:26:22	skullY	line length is the only part of pep8 I don't follow

2017-02-09 15:07:10	saltaner	oh
2017-02-09 15:07:13	josephle	22 gauge/0.8mm is popular

2017-02-09 15:37:42	saltaner	lol
2017-02-09 15:37:51	pikajude	ok so do i put these on the plate first, then put the pcb on and solder the switches or
2017-02-09 15:37:53	pikajude	is that how this works
2017-02-09 15:39:45	saltaner	put the corners in first
2017-02-09 15:40:02	saltaner	then solder those to the pcb
2017-02-09 15:40:42	pikajude	oh ok
2017-02-09 15:40:44	pikajude	makes sense
2017-02-09 15:43:17	pikajude	this instructional video has the guy putting all the switches onto the plate before proceeding with soldering
2017-02-09 15:44:57	saltaner	you have a pretty high chance of not getting the switch leads in the holes
2017-02-09 15:45:29	pikajude	ok
2017-02-09 15:45:48	pikajude	well i went crazy and put four switches on in the middle
2017-02-09 15:45:52	pikajude	but then you saved me the extra trouble
2017-02-09 15:45:55	TheFactIs	also dont forget to put on the stabilizers before you solder

2017-02-09 16:05:36	saltaner	they should snap in or something

2017-02-09 16:09:03	pikajude	i can push them down but they pop back up

2017-02-09 16:18:31	pikajude	arij how do you know when this thing is hot enough
2017-02-09 16:18:35	pikajude	do you just plug it in and wait
2017-02-09 16:18:44	arij	touch the tip to some solder
2017-02-09 16:18:46	arij	see if it melts
2017-02-09 16:18:51	arij	also dont touch the barrel

2017-02-09 16:29:44	SlabDabs	Now that's the fun part if you didn't get a solder sucker
2017-02-09 16:29:54	pikajude	i AM a solder sucker
2017-02-09 16:30:03	pikajude	ok how do
2017-02-09 16:32:06	SlabDabs	Lol, but really, do you have a solder sucker or desoldering braid?
2017-02-09 16:32:42	arij	how did you put lctrl in the wrong place? isnt it a keycap
2017-02-09 16:32:59	pikajude	the switch arij
2017-02-09 16:33:02	pikajude	i put it in the wkl position
2017-02-09 16:33:05	arij	oh
2017-02-09 16:33:19	arij	rip
2017-02-09 16:33:31	pikajude	i don't know what a desoldering braid is
2017-02-09 16:33:33	pikajude	or a solder sucker
2017-02-09 16:33:41	arij	sounds like you dont have one
2017-02-09 16:33:50	arij	just heat up the solder as you pull on the switch
2017-02-09 16:33:58	arij	alternate between pins
2017-02-09 16:34:08	SlabDabs	Hmm, I'm not sure what home options you have. Yeah you can do that but it can be hard with two pins
2017-02-09 16:34:11	arij	pulling it out little by little
2017-02-09 16:34:28	TheFactIs	pulling it out little by little will be a pain but probably fine for one switch
2017-02-09 16:34:45	SlabDabs	If you have any strandy wire you can heat it up against the post so it absorbs some of the solder
2017-02-09 16:35:07	TheFactIs	if you end up having to do a bunch get a solder sucker with a sqeeuze bulb on it
2017-02-09 16:37:47	pikajude	sorry for being nonresponsive, i was trying the little by little approach
