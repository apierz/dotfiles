2016-08-17 07:51:46	DarkPsydeLord	ok so heres a question for python programmers... what do you think is the path from beginner to master in python? no asking faster way to learn im asking about the right way to do it and have strong basics
2016-08-17 07:54:02	mattgirv	DarkPsydeLord: If you have no experience and want to dive straight in, Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is a pretty good grounding.
2016-08-17 07:54:16	sangy	DarkPsydeLord: python is mostly about not reinventing the wheel. I'd just advice to read a little on what's on the standard library + setuptools
